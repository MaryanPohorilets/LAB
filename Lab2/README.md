# Laboratory work 2

# Description
This project involves the following tasks:

1. Solving the quadratic equation and outputting the output data to the console.

2. Determination of the quadrant of the location of the point by coordinates.

3. Determine whether the given number is even or two-digit.

4. Create a program that solves a certain function depending on the given x.

5. According to the number of the day of the week, print whether it is a working day or a weekend, considering Saturday and Sunday as weekends.

6. By the number of the month, indicate which season it belongs to.
