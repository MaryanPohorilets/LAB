# Laboratory work 4

# Description
This project involves the following tasks:

1. Create an empty array and:
   - Fill it with 50 even numbers.
   - Fill it with 50 odd numbers.

2. Make an array of 10 numbers [2,17,13,6,22,31,45,66,100,-18] and:
   - go through it with a while loop
   - go through it with a for loop
   - go through the while loop and output numbers only with an odd index
   - go through the for loop and output numbers only with an even index
   - display the array in reverse order.

3. Calculate the sum of array elements in a one-dimensional array consisting of n real elements.

4. Change the sign of all odd array elements.
