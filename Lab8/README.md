# Laboratory work 8

# Description
This project involves the following tasks:

To perform the task, use streams implemented using the FileWriter and FileReader classes.
1. Implement a program that writes a sequence of random numbers in the range specified using the command line parameters to a file (txt type). The file name is also specified on the command line. In the program, check the existence of a file with a given name, if it is not there, create it before writing to the file.
   To generate a random number within [b1,b2], you can use the formula new Random().nextInt(b2-b1+1)+b1.


2. Read information from the file created in the previous task. Display it on the console.
